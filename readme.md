The objective of the code below is to use the RandAugment Technique for the purpose of auto augmentation to increase the size of the training data set artificially. The augmentation applied is shown to imporve the generalization of deep learning model in the vision tasks

**Task**: One shot learning
**Datasets** used: MNIST, Omniglot
**Model**: Siamese Network
**Objective function**: Pair loss function/contrastive loss function
